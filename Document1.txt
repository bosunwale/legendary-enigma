Welcome to Mobile Application Development
My name is John Oluwale
I am here for the first time
Thank you very much
I want to get comfortable using git. 
Therefroe, expect a lot of me creating repositories.

So i made a mistake by committing this document into the first repo i created
UPDATE: I'm going to commit and push this to the new repo i created called legendary-enigma
